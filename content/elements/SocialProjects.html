<p>###Let’s get on stage! Jedermann in Vienna: a great success!</p>
<p><img src="/img/vienna.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Theater has been part of my younger days for many years! I felt the most alive while stepping on the stage and bringing any character to life! Being an actress gave me the chance to access the most diverse emotions, situations and even eras every time the light on the stages went on and the silence of the audience flood the theater.</p>
<p>Marginalized groups have always had a very close place in my heart.
This is why, when I came across the play organised by the LifeBall in Vienna, a play that aimed to normalize homosexual love while raising funds for Aids Hospice, I finally found a way to fully express my support to this community.</p>
<p>The play took place in the national Cathedral of St. Stephan, a symbol of Christianity and Austrian proud. As I joined the organisation, we were able to involve more than 100 volunteers into putting together a very provocative play that aimed to make the most influential people in Vienna reflect on how sexuality should not be something to be blamed for, especially not in the name of a God. And most importantly, we were able to raise almost 70.000 euros to devolve for Hospices helping young LGBTQ+ who lost their home for who they are.</p>

<h3>The European Union: what a pleasure!</h3>
<p>As an Italian, values such as pluralism, freedom of expression, or peaceful coexistence often seem
self-evident and are too rarely questioned. A glance across national borders is often enough to see
how fragile these concepts can actually be. However, as the daughter of two former refugees, I know
firsthand the complexity and harshness that can arise from an unstable political and social landscape.
This is why I consider it extremely valuable to be able to work on the fundamentals of a free and
diverse democracy.
For this reason I was more than honoured to be chosen to <em>lead a class of more than 70 students</em> to the European Commission in the late winter of 2018! During the field trip we had the great pleasure of meeting the ex-president of
the European Commission, Junker and other prominent personalities!</p>
