### How did the number of Santander Bikes change during the lockdown period?

I decided to run an analysis and plot the results by different months. To do so, I structured the analysis on different levels. 

# Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}

url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"


# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```

I then created a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.


> It becomes clear that the effect of national restrictive measures such as lockdowns have greatly influenced the bikes rent. This helps us explain the difference between the average number of rented bikes in May and June 2020 with previous years.

```{r}
actual_bike <- bike %>%
               filter (year >= 2016) %>%
               group_by(year,month) %>%
               summarise(actual = mean(bikes_hired))

expected_bike <- actual_bike %>%
                 group_by(month) %>%
                 summarise(expected = mean(actual))

comparison_bike <- left_join(actual_bike, expected_bike, by = "month")

comparison_bike
```


```{r, tfl_absolute_monthly_change, out.width="100%"}
comparison_bike %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = month, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = month, y = actual), color = "black", size = 0.1) +
  geom_line(aes(x = month, y = expected), color = "blue", size = 0.8) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = expected, ymax = pmin(expected, actual)),fill = "red", alpha=0.2)  +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = actual, ymax = pmin(expected, actual)),fill = "green", alpha=0.2)+
  facet_wrap(~ year) +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(
    title= "Montly changes in Tfl bikes rentals",
    y="bike rentals",
    x="Months"
  )
```

```{r}
actual_bike_w <- bike %>%
               filter (year >= 2016) %>%
               group_by(year, week) %>%
               summarise(actual = mean(bikes_hired))

expected_bike_w <- actual_bike_w %>%
                 group_by(week) %>%
                 summarise(expected = mean(actual))

comparison_bike_w <- left_join(actual_bike_w, expected_bike_w, by = "week") %>%
                     group_by(week) %>%
                     mutate(dchanges = (actual - expected) / expected )

comparison_bike_w = comparison_bike_w %>%
  filter(!(year ==2021 & week ==53))
```




```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_changemj, out.width="100%"}
comparison_bike_w %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = week, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = week, y = dchanges, fill = "black")) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = pmin(0, dchanges)),fill = "red", alpha=0.2)  +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = dchanges, ymax = pmin(0, dchanges)),fill = "green", alpha=0.2)+
  facet_wrap(~ year) +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(
    title= "Weekly changes in Tfl bikes rentals",
    y= "Bikes rentals",
    x="Weeks"
  )
```


In order to calculate the expected rentals I used the mean of rented bikes/monthly since we thought this was a better measurement. Since the monthly data of the actual rented bikes does not seem to be heavily right/left skewed, the mean is a good tool to calculate the expected rentals. If the data were heavily skewed, we would have changed to the median.
