<h2>My biography</h2>
<p>My name is <strong>Valeria Opre</strong>, I am 24 years old and I grew up in the German speaking region of Italy, South Tyrol. I went to the Italian highschool <em>Liceo Scientifico Torricelli</em>.<br />
I decided to move out and live in Vienna, where i first graduated in <em>Political Science</em> and then completed my second degree with honours in <em>Business, Economics and Social Sciences</em> at the Vienna University of Economics and Business. During this time I had the great chance to do an exchange semester at the SMU in Singapore.</p>
<p>Before applying for my postgraduate studies in London I decided to pursue two internships to better shape my future goals:
+ As a <em>research consultant</em> for <strong>Action Institute</strong>, a renowned economic and political NGO in Milan
+ As an <em>equity analyst</em> for <strong>Wutis</strong>, winning two pitching competition with McKinsey.</p>
<p>Arriving to London for my Masters at LBS I am excited to learn more programming languages and how to use them to make more strategic business decisions!</p>
