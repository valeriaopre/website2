## My biography
My name is __Valeria Opre__, I am 24 years old and I grew up in the German speaking region of Italy, South Tyrol. I went to the Italian highschool _Liceo Scientifico Torricelli_.

\
I decided to move out and live in Vienna, where i first graduated in _Political Science_ and then completed my second degree with honours in _Business, Economics and Social Sciences_ at the Vienna University of Economics and Business. During this time I had the great chance to do an exchange semester at the SMU in Singapore.


Before applying for my postgraduate studies in London I decided to pursue two internships to better shape my future goals: 
  + As a _research consultant_ for __Action Institute__, a renowned            economic and political NGO in Milan
  + As an _equity analyst_ for __Wutis__, winning two pitching competition
    with McKinsey.
 
 
Arriving to London for my Masters at LBS I am excited to learn more programming languages and how to use them to make more strategic business decisions!
